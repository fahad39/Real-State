# Real-State System
This is a Real state system in which we first display home and their address and price.
Then we ask user to enter his budget.
Then we show the user the house that lie in user budget and ask him whether he  want to buy or look for another house or want to exit.
If user want to see another house we show him other available house.
If user want to buy the house we show him the remaining balance.
